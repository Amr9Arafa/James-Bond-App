            and producer who has won an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards (one of them being a 
            BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award) and three Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. 
            DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award). He was knighted by Elizabeth II in July 2000, 
            and received the Kennedy Center Honors in the US.</item>
        <item>Sir Roger George Moore, KBE (born 14 October 1927) is an English actor. 
                He is perhaps best known for playing British secret agent James Bond in the official 
                film series for seven films between 1973 and 1985. He appeared as Bond in more official 
                Bond films than any other actor, and is the oldest actor to play Bond. Moore also portrayed 
                Simon Templar in The Saint from 1962 to 1969. He is also a Goodwill Ambassador for the charity
